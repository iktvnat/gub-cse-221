# Heart Disease Detection

Here is a detailed comparison between your **Heart Disease Prediction project** and the **Data Engineering & Statistics project** from the Jupyter Notebook you uploaded

## **Project Comparison**

This comparison will cover the primary goal, the datasets used, the methods for cleaning and preparing the data, and the final output of each project.

### **1. Project Goal & Focus**

- **Your Project (Heart Disease Prediction):** The goal is very specific and predictive. You are building a complete machine learning pipeline to **classify** whether a patient has heart disease. The focus is on the end-to-end process: cleaning data, training a model (Logistic Regression), and evaluating its predictive accuracy. ðŸŽ¯

- **Notebook Project (Data Engineering & Statistics):** This project is broader and more foundational. Its goal is to teach and demonstrate the core steps of **data engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. It's not trying to predict a specific outcome but rather to show _how_ to clean a "dirty" dataset and analyze its statistical properties. The focus is on techniques like handling missing values, cleaning text, and visualizing distributions. ðŸ§¹

**_Key Difference:_** Your project is a **predictive modeling** task, while the notebook is an **exploratory data analysis** and **data cleaning** exercise.

### **2. Dataset Characteristics & Challenges**

- **Your Project (Heart Disease UCI):**

  - **Challenge:** The dataset is "messy" in a real-world way. It contains a mix of numerical and text-based (`object`) data, and many columns have **significant missing values** (e.g., the `ca` column is over 65% empty).
  - **Structure:** It has a clear target variable (`num`, which you converted to `target`) and several features (medical measurements) to be used for prediction.

- **Notebook Project (Dirty Dataset of Music Tours):**
  - **Challenge:** This dataset is intentionally "dirty" to practice cleaning. It has inconsistent text formatting (e.g., `$` and `,` in numbers), special characters (`â€ `, `â€¡`), and missing values in less critical columns.
  - **Structure:** It's a descriptive dataset without a clear target variable for prediction. The goal is to make the existing data tidy and usable for analysis, not to predict a future value.

**_Key Difference:_** Your dataset's main challenge is **missing data** that needs to be imputed (filled in) to be useful for a model. The notebook's dataset challenge is primarily **inconsistent formatting** that needs to be standardized.

### **3. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

This is where the approaches differ the most, based on the project goals.

- **Your Project:**

  - **Missing Values:** You used **imputation**. For numerical columns, you filled missing entries with the **median**, which is a robust method that isn't skewed by outliers. For text-based columns, you used the **mode** (most frequent value). This is a crucial step to make the data complete for the model.
  - **Categorical Data:** You converted text columns (like `sex`, `cp`) into numbers using **one-hot encoding** (`pd.get_dummies`). This is essential because machine learning models require numerical input.
  - **Feature Scaling:** You used `StandardScaler` to normalize the range of your features. This ensures that features with larger values (like cholesterol) don't unfairly dominate the model's learning process over features with smaller values.

- **Notebook Project:**
  - **Missing Values:** The notebook identifies the missing values but ultimately **drops** the columns (`Peak`, `All Time Peak`) with too many missing entries rather than imputing them. This is a valid strategy when those columns are not essential for the analysis.
  - **Text & Formatting:** The primary focus is on cleaning text. It uses **regular expressions (`re.sub`)** and `lambda` functions to remove special characters, currency symbols, and brackets from the data, converting columns like `Actual gross` into clean numerical types.
  - **Feature Scaling:** This step is not performed because the project doesn't build a predictive model, so there's no need to scale features for an algorithm.

**_Key Difference:_** Your project uses more advanced data preparation techniques (imputation, scaling) required for **predictive modeling**. The notebook focuses on fundamental text cleaning and formatting, which is a key part of **exploratory data analysis**.

### **4. Final Output & Evaluation**

- **Your Project:**

  - **Output:** The final output is a **trained machine learning model** and an **evaluation of its performance**.
  - **Evaluation:** You use clear metrics like **accuracy** (86.96%), a **confusion matrix**, and a **classification report** (precision, recall, f1-score) to judge how well your model predicts heart disease on unseen data. You also visualize the results with heatmaps and charts.

- **Notebook Project:**
  - **Output:** The final output is a **cleaned CSV file** (`dirty_dataset_cleaned.csv`) and basic statistical analyses (like mean, median, and distributions) of the cleaned data.
  - **Evaluation:** There is no model to evaluate. The "success" of this project is measured by how clean and well-structured the final dataset is. It also includes visualizations like histograms and boxplots to understand the data's properties after cleaning.

**_Key Difference:_** Your project's success is measured by **predictive performance**. The notebook's success is measured by the **quality of the cleaned data**.
