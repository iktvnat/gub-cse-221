# Loading and Preparing the Data

'''
    The rows represent the actual true labels of the flowers.

    The columns represent the labels predicted by your model.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the numbers:

    Class 0 (e.g., setosa): The model correctly predicted all 14 actual Class 0 flowers as Class 0. Perfect performance.

    Class 1 (e.g., versicolor): There were 13 actual Class 1 flowers. The model correctly predicted 12 of them but mistakenly predicted 1 as Class 2.

    Class 2 (e.g., virginica): There were 18 actual Class 2 flowers. The model correctly predicted 17 of them but mistakenly predicted 1 as Class 1.

The values on the main diagonal (14, 12, 17) are correct predictions. The off-diagonal values (the two 1s) are the errors.
